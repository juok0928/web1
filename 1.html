  <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
  <a href="http://sangsi.co.kr/kr/" target="_blank" title="symbol of life">We are all diamonds.</a>
  But if you're not sure if you're a diamond, it's only because you're still in a cave.
  The fact that <strong>you are a <u>diamond</u> is invariable.</strong>

  <p>As we live our lives, we encounter many trials, hardships, luck, and opportunities.
  But good or bad, we have to act first to experience something.
  <br>If you're not doing anything, of course, emotional ups and downs, anxiety, and depression will follow.
  <br>But if you shake it off and try and challenge anything, the results will all be your assets, good or bad.</p>
